# Coding Quiz

The goal of this project was to create a simple quiz. Individuals should be able to click on answer choices, and they will be told if their selection was correct or incorrect. The player has the option of clicking the next button to move on. Their timer starts as soon as they answer the first question. If they answer incorrectly, 10 seconds is subtracted from their clock.
